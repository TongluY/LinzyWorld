hi
🐱🐱🐱

I want a cat, not just to hold,
But for the mysteries it unfolds.
A quiet soul, beyond the chase,
A silent mirror of time and space.

I want a cat to teach me still,
To move through life with quiet will.
It asks for nothing, yet has all,
Balanced between the great and small.

In its gaze, I see what's true—
A life complete with nothing new.
I want a cat, to sit and be,
A soft reminder of simply me.
